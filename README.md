The dataset has 39644 number of instances and 61 attributes. There are no missing values.  The problem is a regression problem and a classification problem as well. The objective in a regression problem is to predict the number of shares (target column) of an article. Whereas in a classification problem, i have set the threshold of 1400 shares (below 1400 shares would be an Unpopular Article and above 1400 shares would be a Popular Article), so we need to predict on this basis.
