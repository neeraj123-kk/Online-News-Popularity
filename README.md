Individual Capstone Project


My dataset is provided by UCI Machine Learning Lab, representing a heterogeneous set of features about 2 years of articles published by Mashable. It contains 39797 instances and 61 attributes (58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive, 1 target field).  The following steps below are the procedures approaching my goal:

•	Preprocess the dataset 
•	Use classification algorithms to build classifiers
•	Use max voting learning to predict and conclude the accuracy.
